# When you specify a relative path for a local file, Ansible will try to find 
# that file first in the current taskâ€™s role, then in other roles that 
# included or depend on the current role, then relative to the file in which 
# the task is defined, and finally relative to the current play. It will take 
# the first matching file that it finds. This way, if multiple files with the 
# same filename exist, Ansible will find the file that is closest to the 
# current task and that is most likely to be file you wanted.
